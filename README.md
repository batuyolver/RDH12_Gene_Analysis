# RDH12_Gene_Analysis
Hi,
Retinol dehydrogenase 12(RDH12) is an NADPH-dependent retinal reductase that functions as part of the visual cycle; involving a series of enzymatic reactions that regennerates the visual pigment, 11-cis retinal. RDH12 has 9 coding exons and is located on chromosome 14q24.1. Mutations in RDH12 gene are primarily associated with Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA) and Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP). In this work, i am focusing on RDH12 gene basic analysis that including; nucleotide frequency, determine of AT-GC content ratio and showing of amino acid profile.
